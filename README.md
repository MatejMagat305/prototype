prototype
=========

Simply prototype 2D games using an easy, minimal interface that lets you draw simple primitives and images on the screen, easily handle mouse and keyboard events and play sounds.

Example
-------

```Go
package main

import "github.com/gonutz/prototype/draw"

func main() {
	draw.RunWindow("Title", 640, 480, draw.Resizable, update)
}

func update(window draw.Window) {
	// find the screen center
	w, h := window.Size()
	centerX, centerY := w/2, h/2

	// draw a button in the center of the screen
	window.FillEllipse(centerX-20, centerY-20, 40, 40, draw.DarkRed)
	window.DrawEllipse(centerX-20, centerY-20, 40, 40, draw.White)
	window.DrawScaledText("Close!", centerX-40, centerY+25, 1.6, draw.Green)

	// check all mouse clicks that happened during this frams
	for _, click := range window.Clicks() {
		dx, dy := click.X-centerX, click.Y-centerY
		squareDist := dx*dx + dy*dy
		if squareDist <= 20*20 {
			// close the window and end the application
			window.Close()
		}
	}
}
```
	
This displays a resizable window with a round button in the middle to close it. It shows some basic drawing and event handling code.
